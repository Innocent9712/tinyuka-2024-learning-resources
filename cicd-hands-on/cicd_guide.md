## Introduction to CI/CD

**CI/CD** stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery**. It represents a methodology and set of practices that enable development teams to deliver code changes more frequently, reliably, and with higher quality.

### What is Continuous Integration (CI)?
Continuous Integration is a development practice where developers integrate code changes into a shared repository frequently, typically multiple times per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build and automated tests to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.

### What is Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)?
- **Continuous Delivery**: Ensures that code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for release to production
- **Continuous Deployment**: Goes one step further by automatically deploying every change that passes the automated tests to production

---

## Core CI/CD Concepts

### Version Control Integration
CI/CD systems integrate directly with version control systems (Git, SVN, etc.) to trigger automated processes when code changes occur.

### Automated Testing
Tests run automatically at various stages of the pipeline to ensure code quality and functionality.

### Build Automation
Code is automatically compiled, packaged, and prepared for deployment without manual intervention.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Infrastructure configurations are managed through code, enabling consistent and repeatable deployments.

### Pipeline as Code
CI/CD pipelines are defined using configuration files stored alongside the application code.

---

## Benefits of CI/CD

### For Development Teams
- **Faster Feedback**: Quick identification of bugs and issues
- **Reduced Integration Problems**: Frequent integration reduces merge conflicts
- **Higher Code Quality**: Automated testing catches issues early
- **Increased Productivity**: Less time spent on manual tasks

### For Organizations
- **Faster Time to Market**: Accelerated delivery of features and fixes
- **Reduced Risk**: Smaller, frequent releases are less risky than large deployments
- **Better Customer Satisfaction**: Quicker response to user needs and bug fixes
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduced manual effort and fewer production issues

---

## CI/CD Pipeline Stages

### 1. Source Control
- Code is committed to a version control repository
- Triggers the CI/CD pipeline

### 2. Build Stage
- Code compilation
- Dependency resolution

- Can contain one or more jobs

#### Events
- Triggers that start workflow runs
- Examples: `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`, `workflow_dispatch`

#### Jobs
- Set of steps that execute on the same runner
- Run in parallel by default
- Can be configured to run sequentially with dependencies

#### Steps
- Individual tasks within a job
- Can run commands or use actions

#### Actions
- Reusable units of code
- Can be created by GitHub, the community, or custom-built

#### Runners
- Servers that run workflows
- GitHub-hosted or self-hosted options

### Basic Workflow Structure
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
